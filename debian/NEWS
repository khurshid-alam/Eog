eog (2.8.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The Nautilus "View as Collection" component isn't available anymore.
  
  The release note explanations:

  The by far biggest change for the default GNOME image viewer is the removal 
  of the bonobo components. It comes now as a monolithic program again and 
  makes use of the new wonderful GtkUIManager API. This change leads to great 
  speed improvements and a much better user interface. On the shadow side the 
  Nautilus "View as Collection" component isn't available anymore. It's 
  planned to provide a new Nautilus extension in the future as a replacement.
